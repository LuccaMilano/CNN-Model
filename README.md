# CNN-Model
This project offers different configurations of CNN models focusing on comparing results between them (focusing on time domain x frequency domain)

The files starting with 'Spectral' are models with signals processed by Butterworth, ranging from 2 to 5 linear processing units, making it possible to test different configurations of rhythms (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta).

The files starting with 'Wavelet' are models with signals processed by Wavelet transform, ranging from 1 to 5 linear processing units, making it possible to test different configurations of rhythms (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta).

The files starting with 'Time' are models in the time domain.

All files denote if the validation was made by k-fold or split in the name.
